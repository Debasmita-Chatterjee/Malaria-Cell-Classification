# Malaria-Cell-Classification
Malaria continues to be a major global health concern, transmitted primarily 
through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional 
diagnostic methods based on microscopic examination of blood samples are 
accurate but time-consuming, labour-intensive and heavily dependent on expert 
interpretation. This project proposes the development of an automated malaria 
detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify 
blood cell images as infected or uninfected. The CNN model efficiently extracts 
hierarchical image features, learning to recognize the distinct features of 
Plasmodium-infected cells without the need for manual feature selection. A 
publicly available dataset of labelled cell images was used for training, 
validation, and testing. The model demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and 
recall, confirming its ability to generalize effectively across unseen samples. By 
significantly reducing diagnostic time, this system offers a rapid and reliable 
alternative to manual testing. The study highlights the potential of deep learning 
in transforming medical diagnostics and emphasizes its application in 
improving healthcare accessibility, particularly in resource limited regions.
